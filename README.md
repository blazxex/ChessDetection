# Chess Move Detection from Video

## Overview
This project, part of the final project for the **Digital Image Processing** class at **Chulalongkorn University**, aims to detect chess movements from a video. The project identifies the movement of pieces on the chessboard and outputs each move in the **PGN (Portable Game Notation)** format, which can be used by chess analysis tools and game databases.

The project utilizes **YOLOv11** for detecting hands appearing in the video and **YOLOv8** for detecting chess pieces and tracking their movements.

## Objectives
- Detect the movement of chess pieces in from a video feed.
- Identify the chessboard state at each turn.
- Translate the detected moves into PGN format for easy game tracking.

## Features
- Video input for  chess move detection.
- Automated piece recognition and move detection.
- PGN output format for easy game record-keeping.
- Detection of chess moves.
